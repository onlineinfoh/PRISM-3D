          PRISM-3D is a research pipeline exploring whether targeted anatomical context
          can improve prognostic modeling for NSCLC. The current demo focuses on transparent
          workflow design, visual explainability, and clean clinical-facing interaction.

          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Build a clinically interpretable imaging workflow where segmentation priors and
            deep learning outputs can be reviewed together instead of as isolated results.

          <p>
            End-to-end UI for uploading CT, running segmentation-guided inference, and
            inspecting Grad-CAM overlays across three anatomical planes.

                  <p>
                    Tianxi is an incoming Emory freshman majoring in Chemistry who is
                    chasing the sweet spot where medicine meets machine learning. He wants
                    to become a physician, yet can't resist building medical AI.
                    On our team, he serves as the ML engineer, designing the end-to-end
                    pipeline, training and tuning 3D models.

                  <p>
                    Nishanth is an incoming Georgia Tech mechanical engineering freshman
                    who weirdly lives at the intersection of hardware brain and bio
                    curiosity. When he is not working on PRISM, he is probably geeking out
                    over golf as a side quest. On our
                    team, he leads segmentation and biology, and is the key behind the
                    anatomical reasoning behind the segmentation backbone of our model.

                  <p>
                    Sai is an incoming UT Austin McCombs freshman headed toward investment
                    banking, but he still gets oddly excited about statistics. He works
                    closely with Tianxi, and complements him by zooming in on the results
                    side of the pipeline, making sure our numbers are real and our
                    validation is rock solid. He also leads external outreach with partner
                    hospitals.
